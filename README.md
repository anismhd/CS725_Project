## Abstract
Historically, seismic events have brought extensive destruction and distress to communities worldwide. These events have potential to generate economic losses of up to a staggering $200 billion (Japan, 1995). In the current year alone, over 50,000 lives were tragically lost due to earthquakes(Turkey Earthquake).The most devastating consequence of earthquakes is the ground vibration, which can inflict damage to infrastructure causing huge economic losses. Throughout history, the prediction of this ground motion has remained a challenge for seismology groups. Researchers have explored various empirical equations, commonly known as attenuation equations or Ground Motion Prediction Equations (GMPEs), to estimate ground motion to engineer communities towards more seismic resilience. These empirical relationships were always challenged by new events or information. Recent studies in this field have explored the use of neural networks for the prediction of ground motions. In this project, we intent on an exploration of the application of neural networks in predicting ground motions, aiming to assess their effectiveness in comparison to traditional empirical equations.
